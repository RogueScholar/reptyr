reptyr for Debian
-----------------

My packages are listed on http://wiki.debian.org/LowThresholdNmu with
the intent that other uploaders should feel comfortable fixing bugs
(including updating to a new release).

I'm always happy to have extra help with my packages, but it would be
especially appreciated if you could also make the corresponding
changes to the git repository so I can more easily keep those in sync.

The Debian packaging for reptyr is maintained in the debian branch of
the upstream reptyr git repository, at git://github.com/nelhage/reptyr.

I use pristine-tar to ensure that we can consistently generate the
same orig tarball for a given Debian release of reptyr. When creating
a new Debian release, use

    pristine-tar commit PATH_TO_TARBALL COMMIT-ISH

to associate a particular tarball with a particular commit on the
master branch.

When using a git snapshot for a Debian release, use the
github-generated download of the revision being snapshotted as the
orig tarball. This tarball can be fetched from the URL:

    https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr/tarball/COMMIT

and should be renamed to match the expected form of an upstream
tarball name (i.e. reptyr_VERSION.orig.tar.gz) before importing it
into pristine-tar.

Once a new tarball has been imported, you can merge the tag into the
debian branch

    git checkout debian
    git merge COMMIT-ISH

And generate a new changelog entry

Finally, you can build the package using git-buildpackage

    git build-package -S
